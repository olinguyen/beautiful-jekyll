I'm an Applied Research Scientist at [Element AI](http://elementai.com) working on deep learning applied to problems in natural language processing. More specifically, I'm currently working on problems in information extraction and document understanding.

I completed my MAsc in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Waterloo working on data-driven decision making in healthcare. My research focused on developing methods for home health monitoring and data-driven decision-making systems using the abundance of data coming from various devices today. 

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a research intern at NTT in Japan on media event detection from online videos. I also worked on digital signal processing and embedded systems as a research assistant during my undergrad. Finally, I completed co-op internships as a software developer and participated in many extra-curricular activities in robotic competitions and electronics projects.
 
In my free time, I love playing basketball, hiking, camping, listening to music (hip-hop, jazz and rock in particular).
