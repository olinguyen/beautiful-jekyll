Hey there! I'm Olivier. I'm currently a Master student at University of Waterloo part of the [Health and Data Science Lab](hdsl.uwaterloo.ca) and the [ECE Machine Learning Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/mcrowley/lab).

My research focus is on developing methods for home health monitoring and data-driven decision making systems using the abundance of data coming from various devices today. His research interest mainly include: machine learning, deep learning, data mining, e-health, data visualization and computer vision.

###  Background

Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal.
Before my Masters, I worked as a research intern at NTT in Japan on media event detection from online videos. I also worked on digital signal processing and embedded systems as a research assistant during his undergrad. Finally, I completed co-op internships as a software developer and participated in many extra-curricular activities in robotic competitions and electronics projects.

On his free time, Olivier loves to play basketball, go hiking, watch movies and listen to music.
