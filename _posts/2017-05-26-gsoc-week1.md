Welcome to the first edition of my weekly blogs for Google Summer of Code 2017! I'll be working with the [Shogun](http://shogun.ml) team on a data project for patient monitoring and decision support using health data. I'm really excited about this project because machine learning is being applied in the healthcare domain which has important repercussions on society. While existing methods have been promising, I still believe that the healthcare sector is lacking behind in terms of use of technology in application, and that artificial intelligence should be used more in practice today to improve the delivery, efficiency and quality of healthcare.

For the first week, I focused on building simple models for predicting mortality and the hospital length of stay.

## Intro

Everyday, huge amounts of patient and clinical data are being generated from the healthcare industry and stored in electronic health records. One of the challenges that researchers working on the analysis of health records face is that data was previously made inaccessible, but initatives like the MIMIC database project have allowed for everyone to use and experiment with health data.

## MIMIC Database

The [MIMIC database](https://mimic.physionet.org/
) is a critical care database made freely available for researchers around the world to develop and evaluate ICU patient monitoring and decision support systems that will improve the efficiency, accuracy and timeliness of clinical decision-making in critical care. The data mainly includes demographic, administrative, clinical data and much more from over 45,000 critical care patients.

## Objective

Using the MIMIC database, I focused on these 2 prediction tasks:

1. Mortality prediction
2. Hospital length of stay  

More specifically, I'm interested in learning the following:

1. Extract predictor variables from the MIMIC database
2. Build machine learning models for the 3 predictions tasks
3. Improve performance results using hyper-parameter tuning, or ensemble methods for tree classifiers

## Features

The MIMIC database holds a lot of information about the patient. The charted data or electronic data averages ~5700 measurements for a single patient. For a basic proof of concept, I simply used the general characteristics of the patient like the demographic information, and a few vital sign readings, namely the following:

* Age at the first ICU entry
* Gender
* First care unit
* Max & min heart rate
* Max & min respiratory rate
* Max & min blood pressure

## Basic models

For mortality prediction, which is a binary classification problem, I first experimented with a simple linear SVM whereas for hospital length of stay, I used least squares regression and linear ridge regression. For the evaluation of my models, I used stratified 10-fold and averaged out the auROC over all the folds.

## Preliminary Results

Surprisingly, the results I obtained were better than I expected, with a mean auROC of 77.195% for the linear SVM for mortality prediction. For the prediciton of hospital length of stay, I obtained a mean squared error of 76.58% for both least square regression and linear ridge regression.
