Hiking! One of my favorite activties while I was in Japan. There's just something special and unique about mountains that I can't quite explain. What's so great about hiking in Japan is that it's so accessible/easy to get around. By trains and buses alone I can get to almost any mountain around me. No cars, no plans (it's really easy to just wing it), no camping gear. Most hikes take on average 6 hours to reach the peak, so I stayed at a mountain hut most of the time, or camped out when I was lucky enough to meet nice strangers. Even then, it is totally possible to do day-hikes without having to spend money to stay at a lodge house. I usually preferred to sleep on the mountain so that I could watch the sunset and sunrise at the peaks, but also to enjoy the food prepared at the mountain hut. Finally, a hike in Japan is never complete until one visits an [onsen][onsen] to clean and recover from the long and exhausting hikes.

There is a well-known list of [100 Famous Japanese Mountains][famous-mountains], and I've had the chance to climb 7 of them. Below are some of my pictures and thoughts of my favorite 4 hikes.

### Mt. Hōō

This was my first real hike in Japan, and I fell in love right away. This was also 4 months into my internship (man I was missing out), and I was told that Mt. Hōō (translated Phoenix Mountain in Japanese) was a very difficult hike with a tough trail, so I decided to get hiking boots. It ended up being a great decision, since it was one of the hardest things that I had to do physically. I met some people through Meetup, and we camped out on Saturday night to start hiking Sunday at 3 AM. It took us a long 8 hours to reach the first peak of three peaks, and two more hours to cover the other peaks. From these peaks, we had an incredible view of the southern Japanese Alps (Minami Alps) and Mt. Fuji. In the end, we spent around 15 hours hiking and headed home exhausted to visit an onsen, rest and get ready to work the next day.

### Mt. Tanzawa

This was a hike that was not promising at all. Planning this in the middle of the rainy season in Japan (between June and July), is asking for trouble. My friend's supervisor suggested her to go see a museum instead, and for the first four hours of the hike I was doubting if it was a good idea to do it. At the start of the trail, it was raining, we could barely see anything because of the fog, and there were signs warning us about leeches which we should have paid more attention to. Somehow, I found a leech stuck to my stomach (I have no clue how it got there) and just stood there not knowing what to do like an idiot.

Most mountains in Japan are actually composed of multiple ones. In this case, Mt. Tanzawa is the one listed in the 100 Famous Japanese Mountain, but we covered a total of 4 peaks. After about 5 hours of hiking and almost reaching the highest peak (and most beautiful), we finally saw the clouds clearing up and Mt. Fuji appearing in the distance. When we finally made it to the mountain hut, the owner welcomed us with some curry rice, other delicious food, some music from Enya and what was probably one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever witnessed in my life.

### Mt. Fuji

The tallest and iconic Japanese mountain. Although it's the most famous mountain in Japan, it doesn't mean it's the greatest mountain. Of course, the sunrise at the summit of Fuji is spectacular, but the hike itself is filled with tourists and people, it's an ordinary trail up and a very cold cold night hike.

### Mt. Yatsugatake

Yatsugatake was one of the funnest hikest. The trail itself has a lot of cool climbing and the views are incredible. It's a volcanic mountain range so it's a lot of peak to peak hiking. It was my last hike in Japan, and certainly one of the most memorable.
