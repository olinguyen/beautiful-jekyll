I was recently asked a few times about some travel advice, tips and places to go in Japan. Here's my attempt to provide an all-around guide to travelling in Japan. I'll try to update this when I have more time.

# Transportation

You might want to have a look at the JR Rail Pass (http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/). It can save you money and gives you access to all the trains on the JR line during the chosen period.

# Tokyo Region

## Temples to visit:
- **Asakusa**: This district has one of the oldest temples in Tokyo, and has cool activities and streetfood.
- **Akihabara**: District known as the "electric town". You guys should definitely visit this. Animes, video games, mangas, electronics. You name it. You'll find it all here. Chances are you've already seen the big buildings of this street in movies or animes. There's tons to do in terms of activities: Arcades, weird shops, shopping centers, good food.
- **Shibuya**: This is where the famous Shibuya crossing is (that super-crowded street). Again, lots of shops/stores, great restaurants and stuff to see around this area.
- **Harajuku**: Famous district known for the crazy fashion. You'll see how eccentric and flashy some japanese people can dress up like. There's a lot of shopping here and good snacks.
- **Meji Shrine**: Next to Harajuku, there's a beautiful forest which lies a nice temple. Worth the visit.
- **Tokyo station**: Visit the ramen street here. Good stuff
- **Tokyo Skytree**: Go up high and see the view of the whole city
- **Ginza**: Expensive place in Tokyo, but top restaurants are here. High-class shopping is done here too.
- **Tsukiji fish market**: Fresh sushi. Go early and wait in line. Might be the best sushi you'll have in your life!

## Nightlife:
- **Piss alley (Omoide Yokocho)**: One of my favourite places to eat! It's known as piss alley because salarymen used to get piss drunk and pass out in the alleys (it's not really that dirty now btw). It's a really fun place to go eat. There's a bunch of restaurants in the alleys and it has that Blade Runner (if you've seen the movie) cyberpunk vibe with all the neon lights.
- **Roppongi**: If you have the time to go out and explore, go to the Roppongi district (party zone) if you're feeling wild and adventurous. Pub crawls on weekends with a bunch of foreigners that want to party. Can be dirty but most of Japan is super safe, so you shouldn't worry. Otherwise, Shibuya has a lot cool places to go out. Ageha and Womb are nice nightclubs.
- **Karaoke-ing**. It's super popular in Japan and it's fun.
- For weird restaurants, check out maid cafes, owl cafe's, cat cafe's, Alcatraz (horror restaurant where they close the lights and scare you), zauo restaurant (fish for your own food)

## Events/Festivals:
- **Sumo wrestling**: It really depends on the time of year that you are visiting Japan, but if you have the chance to see a match, do it because it's worth it.
- **Hanami**: If you come during at the end of March or the beginning of April, it is the cherry blossom season in Japan. People like to gather around in parks, have drinks and organize picnics under the cherry blossom trees.
- **Hanabi**: There are lots of fireworks viewings during summer. It shouldn't be too hard to find. Be careful though, it gets pretty crowded on the way back after the fireworks.

# Hakone/Mt. Fuji
A few hours from Tokyo, this is a very relaxing place, where you'll have a beautiful view of Mt. Fuji. Try to book a ryokan (traditional Japanese Inn). You'll be chilling in outdoor hot springs, relaxing, getting massages, wear traditional Japanese dresses. The whole Japanese package.

# Kyoto
There are 1000's of temples here. Here are my favourite spots:

- **Kinkakuji temple (Golden Temple)**: One of the nicest temples in Japan.
- **Arashiyama district**: Bamboo forest, monkey park, nice boat road
- **Ryonanji**: Japanese temple/garden. Really pretty
- **Kyomizudera temple**
- **Gion district**: Traditional neighbourhood. Geisha's used to chill here
- **Maruyama park** (at night)
- **Fushimi Inari**: The classic red frox shines that go on forever

# Osaka
- Osaka Castle
- **Dotonbori**: Downtown osaka. Most of the fun stuff is here. Make sure you try okonomiyaki, takoyaki

# Kobe
If you can fit this in, you get to try the famous Kobe beef!

Let me know if you have any questions, I'll be glad to help out.
