It’s with anxiety and worry that I leave my parents at the airport in Montreal. 21 years living with my parents as the only child. I think the time is right to take a step back and explore the world on my own, make my own mistakes.

Crossing the gate, I’m on my own now. You can sense my insecurity and lack of confidence. My palms are kinda sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy. There’s no vomit on my sweater though.

Finally made it, arriving at Narita Airport 16 hours later. It takes a while for me to pass the customs and get my luggage. I quickly ask for which train to take to get to Yokosuka. Turns out I have about 30 minutes to catch the train so I quickly try to figure out where I’m suppose to go, forgetting to contact my supervisor.

Roughly two hours later, I end up at Ofuna. There’s a message on the display screen indicating that the Yokosuka line is down because a passenger is injured. Great. I look around. There’s a shit ton of people. No way I fit my two luggage with this many people. Screw it, I take the next bus and try to contact my supervisor ASAP so she doesn’t get worried. Ring, ring. Fuck, no answer. Great. Back to trying to get in that train. Turns out there’s a little spot I can sneak my stuff in. Train is crowded as hell, but no one says a damn thing: It’s dead silent. In the train for 30 minutes, and I stop at Yokosuka Station where I meet my supervisor. Or so I thought. After calling her, turns out I was supposed to go to Yokosuka-chuo, not Yokosuka. Cool. It’s 8 PM and we take the cab to my dorm. I feel terrible for making her wait and not contacting her earlier.

At the dorm, I meet a nice intern from UBC. He shows me around and explains a bunch of stuff. After eating food from the Seven Eleven, I sleep and get ready for my first day at work.

And so begins my journey to the opposite of the Earth, 10,379 km away from Montreal: Japan.
