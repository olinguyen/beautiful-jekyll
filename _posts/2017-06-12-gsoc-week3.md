Aniongap, for example, is is the difference between primary measured cations (sodium Na+ and potassium K+) and the primary measured anions (chloride Cl- and bicarbonate HCO3-) in serum. The test is mostly performed in patients who present with altered mental status, unknown exposures, acute renal failure, and acute illnesses [1].
