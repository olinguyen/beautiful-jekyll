Previously, I made predictive models for mortality prediction and predicting patient hospital length of stay using machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs) and random forest. This week, I looked into improving the results from last week by extracting more features from the MIMIC database. More specifically, predictors from three main categories are taken: demographic information, vital sign data and laboratory measurements.  Finally, I added a few more outcomes that I'm trying to predict. Instead of only trying to predict hospital mortality (whether the patient died in the hospital), I added 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality and ICU mortality as additional mortality prediction tasks. For the regression task, the ICU length of stay is also included on top of the hospital length of stay. The code that goes along with this blog can be found in the link [here](https://github.com/olinguyen/gsoc2017-shogun-dataproject/).

| Demographic & Clinical Info             | Description |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Age                     | Age of the patient upon entering the ICU    |
| Gender                  | Patient gender (male or female)             |
| Hospital length of stay | Number of days spent in the hospital        |
| ICU length of stay      | Number of days spent in the ICU             |
| First care unit         | ICU type in which the patient was cared for |
| Admission type          | Admission type the patient entered          |

Let's recall that only simple demographic data and a few vital signs (heartrate, blood pressure and respiratory rate) were used to achieve very modest results (~ 70% AUC). The big difference this time is that a lot more vital signs are included which gives more context about the patients' condition. Additionally, laboratory measurements, which will be further explained, are now included as well.

| Vital sign               | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Heart Rate               | Heartbeat rate of the patient |
| Mean Blood Pressure      | Average pressure in a patient's arteries during one cardiac cycle       |
| Diastolic blood pressure | Pressure when the heart is at rest between beats            |
| Systolic blood pressure  | Pressure when the heart is beating |
| Respiratory Rate         | Number of breaths taken per minute       |
| Temperature              | Temperature of a patient in degrees Celcius            |
| SpO2                     | Amount of oxygen in the blood            |
| Glasgow Coma Scale       | Scoring system used to describe the level of consciousness in a person            |
| Ventilation              | Whether the patient was ventilated or not            |
| Urine output             | How much urine was produced            |

The process for acquiring lab measurements involves acquiring a fluid from the patient's body (e.g. blood from an arterial line or urine from a catheter) and then analyzed in the laboratory. Let's take anion gap as an example of a lab measurement. [Anion gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion_gap) is the difference between primary measured cations (sodium Na+ and potassium K+) and the primary measured anions (chloride Cl- and bicarbonate HCO3-) in [serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_(blood)) (blood). The test is mostly performed in patients with altered mental status, unknown exposures, acute renal failure, and acute illnesses [1]. The plot below shows the aniongap measurement on ICU admission comparison for survival and non-survival groups.

We can observe that the anion gap level is slightly higher for the non-survival group which shows that this is can be an important predictor for mortality. Aside from anion gap, many other laboratory events were included and are recorded in the table below.

| Laboratory measurements |
|-------------------------|
| Aniongap                |
| Bicarbonate             |
| Creatinine              |
| Chloride                |
| Glucose                 |
| Hematocrit              |
| Hemoglobin              |
| Platelet                |
| Potassium               |
| Sodium                  |
| Blood urea nitrogen     |
| White blood cells       |

When combining demographic information, vital signs and laboratory events, we have a total of 48 different features that are used as predictors for our model compared to 9 features previously. Although we now have a lot more features, one of the challenges we now face is that some features contain many NaN and missing values. This is either because the doctor or nurse deemed it to be unnecessary to record a certain measurement for a patient. In the barplot below, we can see which features are complete and the ones that contain more missing values. For now, the features which have a lot of NaNs and missing values will be excluded. Strategies to deal with missing values will be added in the future to make our models more robust and to incorporate as much information as possible.

The results from the logistic regression and linear SVM models were recorded in the tables below for the different prediction tasks. Again, the mean AUC score was computed across all 10 folds from stratified k-fold cross-validation.

| Classifier          | Mean AUC across 10 folds (%) |                  |                    |               |
|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|
|                     | 1 year mortality         | 30 day mortality | Hospital mortality | ICU mortality |
| Logistic Regression | 78.61                    | 82.05            | 83.38              | 85.35         |
| Linear SVM          | 83.19                    | 85.18            | 78.57              | 82.17         |

Compared to the previous model which achieved a mean AUC of around 70%, the additional features produce a score of around 80% for all the mortality prediction tasks. The performance of both logistic regression and linear SVM are also very similar.

| Classifier              | Mean MSE across 10 folds |                    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
|                         | Hospital length of stay  | ICU length of stay |
| Least square regression | 110.726                  | 34.878             |
| Linear ridge regression | 110.726                  | 34.878             |

## Next up

By adding more vital signs and laboratory measurements, I was able to improve by 10% the performance for mortality prediction from around 70% AUC to 80% using logistic regression or linear SVMs. While results have been good, I used a simplistic approach for dealing with missing values and NaNs which was to simply discard them. In the upcoming weeks, I'll look into more effective methods of data imputation to resolve these issues. Additionally, I'll explore dimensionality reduction and feature selection methods to see if the same performance can be achieved with fewer features. Backward and forward feature selection along with principal component analysis are techniques that will be used.
